Run the Tauri commands from this directory, not the repository root.

## Fast Browser UI Development

From this directory, run:

```bash
bun run dev:web
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:1420/home>. This starts only Next.js: Tauri IPC,
the settings store, the local engine HTTP API, and the health WebSockets
are replaced by in-memory browser mocks. Rust and the sidecar are not built or
started, so this is the shortest loop for layout and ordinary React work.

Useful mock states:

```bash
MEMORA_WEB_SCENARIO=empty bun run dev:web
MEMORA_WEB_SCENARIO=backend-error bun run dev:web
```

The default `ready` state also seeds a stateful Live View and canvas document.
Edits such as changing the time range or layout mode are preserved for the
current browser session, so Live View UI work does not need the Rust backend.

To use the real engine while still skipping the Tauri/Rust build, first start
or keep Memora running, then run:

```bash
MEMORA_LOCAL_API_KEY=your-local-key bun run dev:web:live
```

Set `MEMORA_WEB_API_PORT` too if the engine is not on port 3030. The dev
server binds to `127.0.0.1`; the key is embedded in this local development
bundle, so do not use or share a production credential.

Use `bun run dev:tauri` for the full native loop. Browser mode cannot validate
native windows, menus, tray behavior, permissions, updater flows, filesystem
access, or WebKit-only layout/focus behavior. Check those changes in Tauri
before considering them complete.

## Dev Builds Isolation

`bun tauri dev` / `bun run dev:tauri` / `cargo run` do **not** touch the
production install. Every debug build redirects itself at startup:

| | production | dev |
| --- | --- | --- |
| data dir (DB, `store.bin`, secrets, pipes, chats) | `~/.memora` | `~/.memora-dev` |
| local API port | 3030 | 3130 |
| focus / notification port | 11435 | 11535 |

You keep a separate dev profile, so first launch shows onboarding and an empty
timeline. That is expected. To reset, delete `~/.memora-dev`.

Any variable you set yourself still wins, so you can relax one dimension at a
time:

```bash
# real recordings, still on the dev ports and dev settings store
MEMORA_DATA_DIR=~/.memora bun run dev:tauri

# OAuth connections: providers register the callback as localhost:3030 exactly,
# so testing them needs the production port.
MEMORA_PORT=3030 bun run dev:tauri
```

To opt out completely and run against the production profile:

```bash
MEMORA_DEV_USE_PROD_DATA=1 bun run dev:tauri
```

Release builds are never redirected.
